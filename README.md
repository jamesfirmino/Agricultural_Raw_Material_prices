# Agricultural_Raw_Material_prices

The main objectives of the code are:
Data Preparation:
  Cleaning and preprocessing the raw material data for analysis.
Correlation Analysis:
  Calculating and visualizing the correlation matrix to understand relationships between raw material prices.
Price Comparison and Visualization:
  Comparing and visualizing historical price trends for different raw materials using line graphs.
Percentage Change Analysis:
  Analyzing and visualizing the percentage change in raw material prices over time using histograms.
Scatter Plots:
  Visualizing the prices of selected raw materials over time using scatter plots.
Box Plots:
  Analyzing the distribution of prices for selected raw materials using box plots.

The heat map shows the correlation between the raw materials. The higher the correlated value, the greater the chance of two raw materials being related, but not necessarily.

Based on this graph, we can say that there is hardly any relationship between the percentage changes in raw material prices.
A negative value implies that two variables are negatively correlated (one increases, the other decreases).
A value of zero implies no relationship.
Otherwise, the higher the value, the greater the chance of a relationship. Prices and their percentage change graphs.

We can see that cotton and rubber are among the raw materials with lower prices. Let's compare their prices to better understand which one is the lowest.

Cotton is the raw material with the lower price in recent years. Both cotton and rubber are materials with low prices.

We can see that the highest percentage change is over 60% for soft sawnwood, while the lowest percentage change is less than 20% for plywood.

The price change is drastic for hard log price among low-priced materials, and among high-priced materials, it is for fine wool prices.

The interquartile range is defined between the minimum (Q1), first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), maximum, and outliers.


Throughout our analysis, we have discovered raw materials belonging to both high and low price ranges. We have also identified materials with high and low percentage variations. By examining the price trends over the years, we were able to observe the fluctuations and changes in prices. The correlation analysis using the heatmap allowed us to understand the relationships between different raw materials.
